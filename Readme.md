# WIP: A naive implementation of Sparse merkle tree in go

Created this for self-learning purposes, inspired by [github.com/pycckuu/smt](github.com/pycckuu/smt)

### Features
- Make tree with desired depth
- Calculate Root hash
- Insert values in arbitrary leaf position
- TODO : generate merkle proof
- TODO : verify merkle proof
- TODO : delete
- TODO : draw a tree for debugging purposes

### Notes
I used a dummy print function instead of a real hash function to make it easier to understand what is happening.    
there is example in main.go function, just run it and see the results
